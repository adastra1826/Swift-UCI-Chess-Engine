This is currently a work in progress. 

Ever since I discovered programming I've wanted to build an engine. 

On my old TI-83 calculator I made a two person playable chess game that included move validation, check, checkmate, en passant, and castling. 
Unfortunately I never got around to making an engine for it. Of course it would have been essentially a random move engine. 

So this is my attempt at an engine. Enjoy.
